The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global community since its beginning in early 2020. Given the high transmission rates and resulting mortality, many cities and municipalities instituted temporary shelter in place orders, requiring the population to only leave their homes if absolutely necessary. These orders have had unprecedented lifestyle and economic impacts on the population. Similarly, the demand on civil infrastructure systems, e.g., water, energy, and transportation, has shifted away from well established patterns. Our work here aims to provide a comprehensive view on the impact of COVID-19 on various areas of life in the Austin, TX metropolitan area. We document the impact of the pandemic on public health, economy, transportation & mobility, energy and water demand, community needs and air quality using both publicly available and privately sourced data and highlight key insights of the the society's socio-techno-economic fabric.
