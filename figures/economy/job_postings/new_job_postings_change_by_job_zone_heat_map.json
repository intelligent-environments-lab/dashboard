    "Jobs that require lower levels of qualification show the greatest decline in job postings.",
    "Since December, 2020 the number of postings in all qualification levels have shown an increase towards the baseline. Given that the baseline period is Janury 2020, this hints the possibility of seasonality in job postings."
