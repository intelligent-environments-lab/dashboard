    "Between mid-March and mid-April, 2020 there was an abrupt mean decline of -20% in job postings across all job zones.",
    "The lowest mean decline was -53% in December, 2020.",
    "Jobs that require lower levels of qualification show the greatest decline in job postings.",
    "Since December, 2020 the number of postings in all qualification levels have shown an increase towards the baseline. Given that the baseline period is Janury 2020, this hints the possibility of seasonality in job postings."
