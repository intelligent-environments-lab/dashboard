    "During the beginning of March, there was a slight increase in scheduled flights identified by a distinct horn for most of the top 8 destination cities.",
    "This horn is followed by a steep decline in the number of departed flights in the later weeks of March.",
    "By the beginning of May, scheduled flights had equally declined and reached minimum counts for the observed period. However by July, most departures were one-third of or in some cases equal to the levels prior to the decline in May, and the number of cancelled flights had become minuscle.For the most part, departures have remained fairly consistent at the levels observed in July while flights serviced by certain airlines or departing to particular cities have slightly increased."
